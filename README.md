# IGA-Bspline-Cahn-Haliard
Isogeometric analysis for numerical approximation of the Cahn-Halliard equation using the implicit scheme and the generalized alpha method.

### coming soon

## Please install pyccel and start enjoying your research with a simple implementation using simplines

**For your analysis You can find and install the following packages from the url**
